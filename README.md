   - _Open the game on BlueStacks_
   - _Open "Controls editor" (this can be done with CTRL+SHIFT+A)_
   - _On the top right corner of the editor click on the import button_
   - _Open the downloaded file_
   - _A new window named "Import schemes" should open, click on "Select all" and then on "Import"_
   
This is all for the game setup.

#### Use the bot :
1. Download all the files in this repostery : [https://github.com/PyroWilDx/bangdream-bot/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/PyroWilDx/bangdream-bot/archive/master.zip) (don't forget to extract the files)

2. Open Bang Dream on BlueStacks and go to the Home Screen of the game (where we see the characters talking)

3. Make sure you can see BlueStacks on the foreground of your screen. Execute the [main.py](https://github.com/PyroWilDx/bangdream-bot/blob/master/bot/main.py) script on the cmd or with your IDE.  
(If you're new to Python : you can run a python file by using the command ```py file_path\file.py``` in the cmd (i.e : ```py C:\Users\USER_NAME\Downloads\bangdream-bot-master\bangdream-bot-master\bot\main.py```) 

4. Now just follow the next little things the script asks you (*entering 1 or 2; setting up BlueStacks screen etc...*) and the bot should be playing by itself !
